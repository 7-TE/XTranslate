- write text in input fields, mouse over it and press hotkey

You can get even some information from images by putting mouse cursor over the image element and 
press hotkey (title or alt attributes will be used, if applicable).
Even more, with this feature is possible to get auto-selection of text from element under mouse cursor.

Translations in **PDF files** are also supported, but it works only from context menu due technical restrictions of how chrome renders pdf-files.
